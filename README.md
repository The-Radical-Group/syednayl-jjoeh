This is our first mission to R&D our approach.

## 🚀 How to Set Up a Code-Based Challenge?

1. 🐜 Create issues in an existing code or craft a new application with bugs embedded in it. This will form the basis of your challenges.

2. 📝 For each task in a challenge, craft an equivalent Test file. Name them clearly, such as “Task1.test.js”, “Task2.test.js” etc. This will help to ensure tasks are well-organized and easily recognizable.

3. ✅ Each test file will contain multiple unit tests. These are designed to check for resolution or correct output, these are your assertions.

4. 🔄 Set up the GitHub Actions workflow by duplicating this file: [GitHub Workflow File](https://github.com/radicalxdev/demo-mission-01-testing/blob/rnd-code-assessment/.github/workflows/assessment.yml). This will automate your tests and ensure they run consistently.

5. 🧪 To test your workflow, create a PR. This will automatically trigger the GitHub action. Once the test is complete, check out the result here: [Webhook Site](https://webhook.site/#!/d60cc8fd-496c-4d4d-b0ed-32ed274cc7df/ded4d3d1-c2fe-4fbf-b63b-3d59883021b8/1).
